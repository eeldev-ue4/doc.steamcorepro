:::tip TIP
This Example has a Video Tutorial that you can find here: [Related Video](../../videos/dedicated-server.mdx)

There are 2 methods for filtering dedicated server results and that is by using **Tags** or a **Server Object**, lets take a look at how we can use this in the game.

## Filtering using Tags
Tags are separated by “,” comma sign, in this case we’ll use the tags “dedicated” and “modded” as an example.
