# Introduction

## Requirements
There are some requirements when setting up a dedicated server.

- Your own Steam AppId, get this as soon as possible. Using the public AppId 480 is **not ideal**.
- A **remote** server to host the dedicated server on. Remote means **not on your home network**.
- Configured firewall and router (Ports **7777** and **27015** UDP/TCP by default) on the server.
- Firewall/Router needs to accept ICMP/ping requests.
- [Configured Steamworks App](./steamworks.md)
- [Configured SteamCoreSockets](../configuring_steamsockets.md)
